## The Golden Rule: 

ü¶∏ ü¶∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è `Stop starting and start finishing.` üèÅ

If you work on more than one feature at a time, you are guaranteed to multiply your bugs and your anxiety.

## Making a plan

1) **Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"** 
1) **Look at the drawing and name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision**
  - Game title/Header
  - Copy "Pick a shell any shell!"
  - Shell 1
    - hidden pearl
    - Guess button 
  - Shell 2
    - hidden pearl
    - Guess button 
  - Shell 3
    - hidden pearl
    - Guess button 
  - wins
  - losses
  - total (w+L)

1) **Look at the drawing and imagine using the app. What _state_ do you need to track?** 
  - Place Pearl randomly
  - button click
  - Reveal Pearl Placement
  - Wins/Losses/Total-Plays
1) **For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this? (i.e., "we need div to display the results in")** 
  - A pearl - to be found
  - A shell - to conceal the placement
  - Buttons - to pick a shell
  - Div Shells - To place the shell image(s)
  - Div Results - to contain Wins/Losses/Plays
1) **Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How" (i.e., `resultsEl.textContent = newResults`)**
  - getElementById to track clicks
1) **Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, on load etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events. Does any state change? Does any DOM update?**
1) **Think about how to validate each of your features according to a Definition of Done. (Hint: console.log usually helps here.)**
1) **Consider what features _depend_ on what other features. Use this dependency logic to figure out what order to complete tasks.**

Additional considerations:
- Ask: which of your HTML elements need to be hard coded, and which need to be dynamically generated?
- Consider your data model. 
  - What kinds of objects (i.e., Dogs, Friends, Todos, etc) will you need? 
  - What are the key/value pairs? 
  - What arrays might you need? 
  - What needs to live in a persistence layer?
- Is there some state we need to initialize?
- Ask: should any of this work be abstracted into functions? (i.e., is the work complicated? can it be resused?)
